      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Cassandra, and I created this website as a project for the web development track of the Girls Who Code Pathways Summer Program. I am truly passionate about the environment and wildlife because I have witnessed negative impacts on several local areas. From construction of luxurious homes on land that was previously home to horses and farmers to discussions of removing large natural areas to expand local towns, I have seen the harmful results of environmental impacts.</p> 
      <p>By creating this site, I aspire to spread awareness about global and local environmental issues and hopefully inspire others to do the same. Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope that you will consider learning more about the environmental issues or wildlife displacement in your locality.</p>

    <h3>The Earth is home to various, diverse species and should remain that way.</h3>
