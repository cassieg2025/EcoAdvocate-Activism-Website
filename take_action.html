  <h2>Why?</h2>
        
      <p>Advocating for environmental protection is crucial to the future of our planet and to the health of all life on Earth. Supporting efforts to reduce hazards that threaten the environment can help minimize disastrous consequences that are already beginning to form. According to the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/en">ICUN Red List</a>, "more than <strong>47,000</strong> species are threatened with extinction." This problem is dramatically threatening the ecosystem's health.</p>
